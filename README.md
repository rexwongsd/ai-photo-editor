Of course! Building a full-stack photo editor is a fantastic project that combines frontend user interface challenges with backend processing and storage. This is a very visual and rewarding application to build.
Let's architect and build it together.
Phase 1: Planning & Scoping (The Blueprint)
First, we need to define what our photo editor will do. Photo editing can range from simple filters to complex, Photoshop-like tools. We'll aim for a powerful but achievable MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
User Stories (MVP)
As a visitor, I want to...
...upload a photo from my device without needing to sign up.
...see my uploaded photo in a central canvas.
As a user (on the editor page), I want to...
...apply basic adjustments to my photo, such as Brightness, Contrast, and Saturation.
...apply pre-made filters (like "Greyscale," "Sepia," "Vintage").
...crop my image to a specific aspect ratio or a freeform selection.
...rotate or flip my image.
...see a "before" and "after" comparison.
...undo or redo my edits.
...download the final edited image to my device.
As a registered user, I want to...
...sign up and log in to my account.
...save my edited photos to a personal gallery in my account.
...view all my saved photos in my gallery.
...delete a photo from my gallery.
Core Features
Client-Side Editing Engine: The core of the application. All adjustments and filters will happen in the user's browser for speed and responsiveness.
Image Upload & Display: A simple way to get an image into the editor.
Adjustment Controls: Sliders for brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.
Filter Gallery: Buttons for one-click filters.
Transformation Tools: Crop, rotate, flip.
History Management: Undo/redo stack.
Image Export: A function to download the final image as a JPEG or PNG.
User Authentication (Optional but recommended): Sign up/in to enable cloud storage.
Cloud Gallery: A backend and database to store user images.
Data Models (for the optional gallery feature)
User: Standard model for accounts.
EditedImage:
id: Unique ID.
storageUrl: The URL where the image is stored (e.g., in an S3 bucket).
thumbnailUrl: A smaller version for faster gallery loading.
fileName: "my-vacation-photo.jpg".
createdAt: Timestamp.
userId: Links to the user who owns it.
Phase 2: Architecture & Technology Stack
This project has two distinct parts: the high-performance client-side editor and the standard full-stack backend for the gallery.
1. Frontend (The Editor Engine)
Framework: Next.js (React).
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
The Core Graphics Library: We need a powerful library to manipulate the image on an HTML <canvas> element. Fabric.js is an excellent choice. It provides an object model on top of the canvas, making it easy to manage images, apply filters, and handle transformations.
State Management: Zustand or React's built-in useReducer for managing the editing history (undo/redo).
2. Backend (The Gallery & Storage)
API Layer: tRPC (within Next.js).
Database: PostgreSQL (on Supabase/Railway).
ORM: Prisma.
Authentication: NextAuth.js.
File Storage: This is critical. We cannot store image files directly in our database. We need a dedicated object storage service. AWS S3 is the industry standard. We will upload files directly from the browser to S3 to avoid overloading our server.
Architectural Flow of Saving an Image
A user finishes editing their photo in the browser and clicks "Save to Gallery".
The frontend makes a request to our backend (a tRPC mutation) saying, "I want to upload a file named my-photo.png."
Our backend uses the AWS SDK to generate a pre-signed URL. This is a temporary, secure URL that grants the frontend permission to upload a specific file directly to our S3 bucket.
The backend sends this pre-signed URL back to the frontend.
The frontend takes the final image data from the canvas and performs a PUT request to the pre-signed URL, uploading the image directly to S3.
Once the upload is complete, the frontend makes a second request to our backend (another tRPC mutation) saying, "The upload is complete. The file is at [S3_URL]. Please save this to the database."
The backend creates a new EditedImage record in the PostgreSQL database, linking the S3 URL to the user's account.
Phase 3: Backend & Storage Setup
Let's set up the "cloud" part of our application.
1. Prisma Schema
In prisma/schema.prisma:
Generated prisma
// (Include User, Account, Session models for NextAuth)

model EditedImage {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  fileName     String
  storageUrl   String   @db.Text // URL to the full-size image in S3
  thumbnailUrl String   @db.Text // URL to the thumbnail in S3
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())

  user   User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  userId String
}
Use code with caution.
Prisma
Run npx prisma db push.
2. Set up AWS S3 Bucket
Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
Go to the S3 service in the AWS Console.
Create a new bucket. Give it a unique name (e.g., my-photo-editor-app-12345).
Crucially, uncheck "Block all public access". We will manage access with policies, but the files themselves need to be readable.
After creating the bucket, go to the "Permissions" tab and edit the CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing) configuration. This allows our website (running on Vercel) to upload files to our S3 bucket.
Generated json
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "GET"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "http://localhost:3000",
            "https://your-production-url.vercel.app"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
Use code with caution.
Json
Create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with programmatic access. This will give you an Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. Grant this user permissions to PutObject and GetObject on your S3 bucket. Store these keys securely in your .env file.
3. tRPC Mutation for Pre-signed URL
Install the AWS SDK: npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
Generated typescript
// src/server/api/routers/image.ts
import { S3Client } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
import { createPresignedPost } from "@aws-sdk/s3-presigned-post";
import { z } from "zod";
import { createTRPCRouter, protectedProcedure } from "../trpc";

export const imageRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  // Gets a presigned URL for uploading a file
  createPresignedUrl: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ fileName: z.string(), fileType: z.string() }))
    .mutation(async ({ input }) => {
      const s3Client = new S3Client({
        region: process.env.AWS_S3_REGION!,
        credentials: {
          accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID!,
          secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY!,
        },
      });

      // Creates a temporary POST policy for the client to use
      return createPresignedPost(s3Client, {
        Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME!,
        Key: `uploads/${Date.now()}_${input.fileName}`,
        Fields: {
          'Content-Type': input.fileType,
        },
        Conditions: [
          ['content-length-range', 0, 10485760], // up to 10 MB
        ],
        Expires: 60, // Expires in 60 seconds
      });
    }),

  // Saves the image metadata to the database after upload is complete
  saveImageToGallery: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({
        fileName: z.string(),
        storageUrl: z.string().url(),
        // TODO: Create and save a thumbnail URL as well
    }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
        return ctx.prisma.editedImage.create({
            data: {
                fileName: input.fileName,
                storageUrl: input.storageUrl,
                thumbnailUrl: input.storageUrl, // Placeholder
                userId: ctx.session.user.id,
            }
        });
    }),
});
Use code with caution.
TypeScript
Phase 4: Frontend Editor Development
This is the most visually complex part.
Install Fabric.js: npm install fabric
Example Editor.tsx Component
This is a simplified example of the core logic.
Generated tsx
import { fabric } from 'fabric';
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const Editor = () => {
  const canvasRef = useRef(null);
  const fabricCanvasRef = useRef<fabric.Canvas | null>(null);
  const [image, setImage] = useState<fabric.Image | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = new fabric.Canvas(canvasRef.current, {
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
    });
    fabricCanvasRef.current = canvas;

    return () => {
      canvas.dispose();
    };
  }, []);

  const handleImageUpload = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = (event) => {
      const imgData = event.target?.result as string;
      fabric.Image.fromURL(imgData, (img) => {
        fabricCanvasRef.current?.clear();
        img.scaleToWidth(800); // Scale image to fit canvas
        fabricCanvasRef.current?.add(img);
        fabricCanvasRef.current?.centerObject(img);
        setImage(img);
      });
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  };

  const applyGreyscale = () => {
    if (!image) return;
    image.filters?.push(new fabric.Image.filters.Grayscale());
    image.applyFilters();
    fabricCanvasRef.current?.renderAll();
  };
  
  const changeBrightness = (value: number) => {
    if (!image) return;
    // Remove old brightness filter if it exists
    image.filters = image.filters?.filter(f => !(f instanceof fabric.Image.filters.Brightness));
    // Add new one
    image.filters?.push(new fabric.Image.filters.Brightness({ brightness: value / 100 }));
    image.applyFilters();
    fabricCanvasRef.current?.renderAll();
  }

  const handleDownload = () => {
    const dataUrl = fabricCanvasRef.current?.toDataURL({
      format: 'png',
      quality: 1,
    });
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = dataUrl!;
    link.download = 'edited-image.png';
    link.click();
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <div className="mb-4">
        <input type="file" accept="image/*" onChange={handleImageUpload} />
      </div>
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} className="border-2 border-gray-400" />
      <div className="mt-4 flex gap-4">
        <button className="p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded" onClick={applyGreyscale}>
          Greyscale
        </button>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <label htmlFor="brightness">Brightness:</label>
            <input type="range" id="brightness" min="-100" max="100" defaultValue="0" onChange={(e) => changeBrightness(parseInt(e.target.value))} />
        </div>
        <button className="p-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded" onClick={handleDownload}>
          Download
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Editor;
Use code with caution.
Tsx
This skeleton shows the core mechanics:
Initialize a Fabric.js canvas.
Load an uploaded image onto it.
Create functions that modify the filters array of the image object.
Call applyFilters() and renderAll() to see the changes.
Use toDataURL() to get the final image data for download or upload.
The full implementation would involve creating UI controls (sliders, buttons) for each filter and adjustment, a robust state management system for undo/redo, and the cropping/transformation UI.# ai-photo-editor
